# FIASSE / SSEM Reference Data

35 structured FIASSE section files sourced from the [FIASSE RFC](https://github.com/Xcaciv/securable_software_engineering/blob/main/docs/FIASSE-RFC.md) by Alton Crossley.

FIASSE (Framework for Integrating Application Security into Software Engineering) provides the overarching strategic approach. SSEM (Securable Software Engineering Model) provides the design language with 9 core attributes grouped into 3 pillars: Maintainability, Trustworthiness, and Reliability.

## File Format

Each file has YAML frontmatter with:

```yaml
---
title: "S3.2.1 Maintainability"
fiasse_section: "S3.2.1"
ssem_pillar: "Maintainability"             # (optional) SSEM pillar
ssem_attributes:                           # (optional) SSEM sub-attributes
  - Analyzability
  - Modifiability
  - Testability
when_to_use:                               # Task-matching triggers
  - reviewing code for maintainability
  - assessing analyzability of a codebase
threats:                                   # Security implications addressed
  - undetected vulnerabilities due to complex code
  - slow vulnerability remediation
summary: "Definitions and contributing factors for Maintainability sub-attributes."
---
```

Followed by the FIASSE section content. Sections that define measurable requirements use a table:

```
| Metric | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Volume (LoC) | Quantitative | Overall size of the codebase |
```

## SSEM Model Reference

| **Maintainability** | **Trustworthiness** | **Reliability** |
|:---------------------|:---------------------:|----------------:|
| Analyzability        | Confidentiality       | Availability    |
| Modifiability        | Accountability        | Integrity       |
| Testability          | Authenticity          | Resilience      |

## Usage in Skills

### Securability Engineering Review (`/securability-engineering-review`)

When scoring SSEM attributes, reference the specific section for definitions and measurement criteria:

```markdown
- **FIASSE Ref**: S3.2.1 Maintainability — Analyzability (S3.2.1.1)
- **Measurement**: S3.4.1 Measuring Maintainability
```

### FIASSE Code Analysis (`/securability-engineering-review`)

When identifying code-level threats, use the "What can go wrong?" framework and map identified issues to the relevant SSEM attributes and FIASSE sections for context and remediation guidance.

Use `when_to_use` frontmatter to match tasks to relevant FIASSE sections. For example, when reviewing dependency management:
- `S4.1` — Applying SSEM to Dependency Management
- `S6.5` — Dependency Management Practices

### Task-Based Lookup

Use the `when_to_use` and `ssem_attributes` frontmatter to match analysis tasks to relevant sections.
