Extract FIASSE RFC sections into structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

Parses the FIASSE RFC markdown (from Xcaciv/securable_software_engineering) and
produces one file per logical section under data/fiasse/. Each output file has
YAML frontmatter (title, fiasse_section, ssem_pillar, ssem_attributes,
when_to_use, threats, summary) followed by the section content.

Section files are named S{x.y}.md (e.g. S3.2.1.md) matching the RFC numbering.
